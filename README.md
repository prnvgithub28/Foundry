## ✨ **Why Foundry?**

Lost items are a **billion-dollar campus problem**. Students lose textbooks, wallets, phones, and irreplaceable items every single day. Traditional lost & found systems are broken—items get buried, forgotten, or never matched with their owners.

**Foundry changes that.**

With AI-powered image recognition and intelligent matching algorithms, Foundry connects lost items with their owners in **minutes, not months**. Whether you're searching manually or letting our AI do the heavy lifting, we've got your back.
